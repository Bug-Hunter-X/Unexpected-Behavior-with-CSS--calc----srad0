The CSS property `calc()` is used to perform calculations within CSS. However, there are cases where the calculation might not produce the expected result due to unexpected spaces or missing units. For example, `width: calc(100% - 20px)` will work correctly, but `width: calc(100% - 20 px)` will not, and `width: calc(100%-20px)` may lead to unexpected results depending on the browser.  Another common issue is the use of incompatible units within the calculation. For example, `width: calc(100% - 20em)` is fine, but mixing percentages and `px` with `em` may cause issues due to different reference points.
